# LF-Disparity-Estimation-VS-Sub
LF disparity estimation dataset and view-selective convolution-based cost volume construction method
We propose the TO-LF dataset, designed to address challenges in complex occlusion scenarios and textureless region handling, which provides high-quality RGB light field images paired with accurate disparity maps. The TO-LF dataset comprises 60 training images, 6 validation images, and 12 test images.  The test set is categorized into ``Texture'' and ``Occlusion'' subsets. The ``Texture'' subset involves scenes with textureless areas or repetitive patterns, whereas the ``Occlusion'' subset contains scenes with complex self-occlusions or depth discontinuitiesï¼Œ as illustrated below.

The train set and validation set can be downloaded in [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14pvZdMePc57S2UBqgAjxZg?pwd=dhuu)

The GT disparity maps for test scenes are AES-encoded, and a Matlab evaluation script  (.p file) is provided for standardized evaluation. ****They will be released soon after the manuscript is accpted****
